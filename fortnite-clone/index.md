# Fortnite clone


## :)
This is a very old project where I made a Fortnite clone using unreal engine with mostly blueprints. At the time I really wanted to recreate the building mechanics that Fortnite had. In the process of making this game I learned a lot about:
- Data structures
- Blueprints
- Replication


This is quite an old project so I don't have much to say about it anymore but I am proud of the end result.
