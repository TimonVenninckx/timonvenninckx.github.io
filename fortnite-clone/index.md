# Fortnite clone


### Introduction

This is a very old project where I made a Fortnite clone using unreal engine with mostly blueprints. At the time I really wanted to recreate the building mechanics that Fortnite had. In the process of making this game I learned a lot about:
- Data structures
- Blueprints
- Replication

*I honestly don't remember much from the project but wanted to showcase it.*
