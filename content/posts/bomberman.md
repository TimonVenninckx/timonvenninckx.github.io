### Introduction

For my first block at BUAS we were challenged to recreate Bomberman with C++ without using any of the STL libraries. We were given a template that contained some math and ways to draw sprites on the screen.

### Things I learned
I learned a lot about different ways to structure your data and how memory and really works. Managing the memory yourself and looping over the individual pixels to e.g. do Pixel-perfect collision was really valuable. This made me rethink computer memory itself.




### 8 Weeks of block A
This video shows the progress I made during the block.
Also shows some extra things I did such as learning OpenGL & simple networking.
