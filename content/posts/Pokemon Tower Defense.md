### Introduction
Pokemon Tower Defense is a project that i started because i was playing the original game alot but the servers happened to go down. I wanted to challenge myself to make this game with SFML a multimedia library which i didn't have much knowledge of at the time.

### What I learned

I learned a lot about memory management in this project what to look out for, what to do and what **NOT** to do.

Learned a lot about loading textures, levels and data into memory and unloading it after it is not needed anymore.

Working with SQLite database creating, reading and saving data.
