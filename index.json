As they have to be generated across chunk-borders and have to generated the same way in any order e.g. Northern chunk first then southern or the inverse. What I ended up going for was for every 20x20 chunks region It would decide if there was going to be a village or not. You could then check if your chunk falls within a village region and if It does we start generating the village roads. first the RNG is seeded by the region X\u0026Z-coordinates scrambled. Then It generates some roads going in both directions, they can have variable lengths. We store their AABB’s and then start looping over all the roads and at pseudo-random (the RNG is still based on the seed) locations next to the road It tries to place houses by checking if their AABB overlaps with any roads or generated structure. Then after we generated the roads and structures we check if ANY of them START in the current or neighbouring chunk. If they do we start generating the structure from their origin and if any of the blocks we’re trying to place fall into the currently generating Chunk we update the blocks. struct VillageStructure { INTAABB aabb{}; StructureTypes type{}; int rotation{}; // 0, 90, 180, 270 }; struct VillagePlan { glm::ivec2 center{}; std::vector\u003cVillageStructure\u003e structures; std::vector\u003cINTAABB\u003e roads; // x1, z1, x2, z2 }; I think the end result looks quite believable (Raspberry Pi 4) ","date":"2026-01-16","objectID":"/minecraft/:4:2","tags":null,"title":"Minecraft remake","uri":"/minecraft/"},{"categories":null,"content":"Modular data Block state support I made a custom file format for the items in my game however they use Minecraft model logic so I could use there models without making a bunch on my own. However this turned out to be quite a pain as Minecraft’s texture packs have a lot of different versions and a bunch of legacy/hardcoded values. I made sure that my blocks can easily add behaviors and you can change the blockstates to use a different block. Here is an example. { \"name\": \"Oak Door\", \"type\": \"block\", \"blockstates\": \"oak_door\", \"icon\": \"item/oak_door\", \"behaviors\": [ \"facing\", \"open\", \"tallblock\" ], \"transparent\": false, \"gravity\": false, \"stack_size\": 16 } Minecraft model It’s also possible to use a singular model instead of a block states file which points to model files. Almost all (if not all) Minecraft model files are supported. Here is an example of a crafting table which has the crafting functionality added in behaviours, I could also add this behaviour to another block and it would work the same. { \"name\": \"Crafting Table\", \"type\": \"block\", \"model\": \"block/crafting_table\", \"behaviors\": [ \"crafting\" ], \"transparent\": true, \"gravity\": false, \"stack_size\": 64 } Items Items have different files(durability not used yet). { \"name\": \"Diamond Pickaxe\", \"icon\": \"item/diamond_pickaxe\", \"durability\": 59, \"mining_level\": 1, \"attack_damage\": 5, \"attack_speed\": 1.2 } Block state logic I made Block Behavior to work with the minecraft blockstates these had functions they could override in the placement/destruction phase or when the block is being “used” by a player. class BlockBehavior { public: virtual bool TryPlace(const glm::ivec3\u0026 position, ChunkManager\u0026 manager)const { return true; } virtual void OnPlace(const BlockData* blockData, BlockChangePlan\u0026 plan,const BlockPlaceData\u0026 hit)const {} virtual void OnDestruction(const BlockData* blockData, BlockChangePlan\u0026 plan)const {} virtual bool OnUse(Player* player, const BlockData* blockData, BlockChangePlan\u0026 plan)const { return false; } }; These are probably more like interfaces and the implementation is not as great as I think it could be but it does what it needs to. The state of each block is encoded as a single Byte, as long as we don’t attach too many behaviours with many states to a block.
